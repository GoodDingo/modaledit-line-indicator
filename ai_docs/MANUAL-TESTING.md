# Manual Testing Checklist for ModalEdit Line Indicator

**Purpose:** Verify visual appearance of line highlights, which cannot be automated due to VS Code API limitations.

**Last Updated:** 2025-11-17

---

## Why Manual Testing?

The VS Code Extension API does not provide methods to query decoration colors or styles. Therefore, visual appearance MUST be verified manually by human observation.

**What automated tests cover:**
✅ Logic, events, state changes, error handling

**What manual tests cover:**
✅ Decoration colors, visual appearance, theme compatibility

---

## Prerequisites

Before starting manual tests:

- [ ] VS Code installed (version 1.106.0+)
- [ ] ModalEdit extension installed
- [ ] ModalEdit Line Indicator extension installed
- [ ] ModalEdit keybindings configured:
  - Escape → Normal mode
  - i/a/o → Insert mode

**How to verify ModalEdit keybindings:**
1. Open Command Palette (Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+P)
2. Type "Preferences: Open Keyboard Shortcuts"
3. Search for "modaledit"
4. Verify keybindings are set

---

## Test Environment Setup

1. **Open VS Code**
2. **Open any file** (or create test file with content)
3. **Open Output Channel:**
   - View → Output
   - Select "ModalEdit Line Indicator" from dropdown
4. **Open Debug Console:** View → Debug Console
5. **Verify activation:**
   - Look for "=== ACTIVATION COMPLETE ===" in output

---

## Test 1: Basic Mode Detection

### Test 1.1: Normal Mode (Green)

**Steps:**
1. Press `Escape` (enter normal mode)
2. **Verify ModalEdit status bar** shows "NORMAL" mode
3. **Verify line highlight:**
   - Background: Semi-transparent green
   - Border: Solid green (2px by default)
   - Entire current line is highlighted

**Expected:**
- ✅ Line has GREEN tint
- ✅ Green border visible on left
- ✅ Highlight follows cursor position

**If FAIL:**
- Check Output channel for errors
- Run command: "Query Current Mode" → Should show "NORMAL (green)"
- Check ModalEdit is in normal mode (status bar)

---

### Test 1.2: Insert Mode (Red)

**Steps:**
1. Press `i` (enter insert mode)
2. **Verify ModalEdit status bar** shows "INSERT" mode
3. **Verify line highlight:**
   - Background: Semi-transparent red
   - Border: Solid red (2px by default)
   - Entire current line is highlighted

**Expected:**
- ✅ Line has RED tint
- ✅ Red border visible on left
- ✅ Highlight follows cursor position

**If FAIL:**
- Check Output channel for errors
- Run command: "Query Current Mode" → Should show "INSERT (red)"
- Check ModalEdit is in insert mode (status bar)

---

## Test 2: Mode Switching

### Test 2.1: Insert → Normal

---

### Test 2.3: Rapid Switching

**Steps:**
1. Rapidly press: Escape, i, Escape, i, Escape, i (6 switches)

3. **Observe color changes**

**Expected:**
- ✅ Colors track switches correctly
- ✅ No incorrect colors

---

## Test 3: Cursor Movement

### Test 3.1: Vertical Movement

**Steps:**
1. Create file with 10 lines of text

- ✅ Highlight doesn't disappear

---

## Test 4: Wrapped Lines

**IMPORTANT:** This tests multi-line visual wrapping

### Test 4.1: Long Line Wrapping

**Steps:**
1. Make VS Code window narrow (so lines wrap)
2. Type a very long line (200+ characters, wraps to 3+ visual lines)
3. Place cursor on that line
4. Enter normal mode

**Expected:**
- ✅ **ALL wrapped portions** are highlighted (not just first visual line)
- ✅ All wrapped portions show same color
- ✅ Border appears on left of first visual line only

**This is CORRECT behavior and should be documented.**

---

## Test 5: Multiple Editors

### Test 5.1: Split Editors - Same Mode

---

### Test 5.2: Split Editors - Different Modes

**Steps:**
1. Open two files side by side

4. Click back and forth

**Expected:**
- ✅ Left editor shows GREEN when active
- ✅ Right editor shows RED when active
- ✅ Each editor remembers its mode
- ✅ Colors don't mix or interfere

**NOTE:** Both editors will actually be in the same ModalEdit mode (ModalEdit is global). This tests that highlight follows active editor correctly.

## Test 11: Regression Testing

**Run after any code changes:**

**Quick regression test** (10 minutes):

2. Test 2.1: Mode switching (insert → normal)
3. Test 2.2: Mode switching (normal → insert)
4. Test 4.1: Wrapped lines
5. Test 6.4: Disable/enable
6. Test 7.1: Query mode command

**If all pass:** Changes likely safe

**If any fail:** Investigate thoroughly

---

## Known Limitations

### Limitation 1: Mode Change Without Cursor Movement

**Behavior:**
- If you switch modes WITHOUT moving cursor, highlight might not update until next cursor movement

**Reason:**
- Extension uses cursor movement as proxy for mode changes (documented in architecture)

**Workaround:**
- Move cursor after switching modes
- This is by design, not a bug

---

### Limitation 2: Search Mode

**Behavior:**
- ModalEdit's search mode shows same color as normal mode (green)

**Reason:**
- ModalEdit sets `modaledit.normal = true` for search mode
- Extension cannot distinguish search from normal

**Workaround:**
- None currently
- Would require ModalEdit to expose separate search mode context

---

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: Colors don't change

**Check:**
1. Is ModalEdit installed? (Extensions panel)
2. Is ModalEdit active? (Check status bar)
3. Are you moving cursor after switching modes?
4. Run "Query Current Mode" - what does it show?
5. Check Output channel for errors

---

### Problem: Wrong colors

**Check:**
1. Check settings - are colors customized?
2. Reset to defaults
3. Reload VS Code
4. Check theme compatibility

---

### Problem: No highlight at all

**Check:**
1. Is extension enabled? (Settings)
2. Is extension activated? (Check Output channel)
3. Run "Toggle Enabled" twice
4. Reload VS Code window
